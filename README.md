recorder
========
A pair of tiny scripts I wrote for my Dad to help him record stuff off the
internet. They're written very specifically to his requirements and usecase, so may well not be useful to anyone else as-is. They both depend on zenity (and so gtk) for drawing dialogue boxes.

recorder.sh is a bash script that records all sound output for a specified time. He uses it to record non-iplayer radio programs.

iplayer.sh is a python script to download & convert iplayer radio
programs given a url. Uses get\_iplayer.
